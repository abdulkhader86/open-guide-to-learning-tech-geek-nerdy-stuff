## Introduction

Over time I've built a decent list of links to web resources which contain good material to learn stuff.

What stuff? "Tech" stuff (like Python, BSD, Vim, Security, Javascript, Unix), or other geeky/nerdy stuff (math, how to learn the Korean language, Philosophy, etc).

An example of one of these links could be a simple line like this, with a few words to describe what it is, and the actual link:
- BSD: https://hardenedbsd.org/

Or like this:
- Learn Korean: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9935042

When there were multiple links related to the same topic, I would put them together (in no particular order) under a category, such as this:

**Python**

- Tutorials to learn Python: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10135935
- Python Sudoku: http://norvig.com/sudoku.html
- Python IDE: http://pybee.org/

### Making this list publicly available, and letting everyone collaborate
I think it is valuable to make this list available to everyone, and most importantly, open to anyone's contribution.
If you know how to use Github, it should be easy for you to add your own links.
Over time, my hope is that these contribution will make this list of resources very useful as a good "filter" to find just the good stuff.

### Principles behind adding new stuff
The principles behind adding a new link (or a new category) are the following:
1) You can propose a new category if it belongs to the same tech/geek/nerd stuff.

2) You can propose a new "link", by actually simply adding

$category: $succint_description $link 

(e.g. Video games and AI: http://togelius.blogspot.com/2016/01/why-video-games-are-essential-for.html)

If your link points to a discussion, which then points to the actual resource, such as in the case of a Hacker News discussion, you can simply write this: 

$category: $succint_description $link-to-discussion and $link-to-resource 

(e.g. Berkeley AI Materials: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10929985 and http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html)
